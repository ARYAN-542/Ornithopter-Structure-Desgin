(![alt text](<PROTOTYPE-1 GEAR MECHANISM DESGIN-1.jpg>))
This image explains the Gear Mechanisms of Our Ornithopter in Which the Most important part is the Gears which are as Follows:
a.GEAR-1 and 2= Its a pair of 2 Gears interlocked in each other so that onthe movement of one gear the other gear spins simultaneously .

b.GEAR-3= Its the important gear that is mounted on the frame behind the gear 1 and 2 and is interlocked with gear 1 and is responsible for the spinning of both  gear 1 and 2 for the actuation of wing mechanism.

The following Sketch illustrates the wing desgin of the ornithopter which is as follows:

a.WING FRAME AND WING MEMBRANE = It is made up of a stiff and flexible material like fibre or wood extended across the wings to hold the wings and give strenght to the wings to generate an efficient lift.

b.WING FOIL= It is a thin sheet like material that is flexinle , strong and lightweight to help generate lift efficiently.
